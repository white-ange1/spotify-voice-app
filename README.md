# Spotify Voice Control App
A **voice-controlled** app to manage **Spotify playback** hands-free.

**(WIP)** Continuous voice-input

This project started as a **web app MVP** as this is what I was most familiar with, and I'm now working on evolving it into a **Native Android App** for seamless mobile experience.
**NOTE:** I won't be working on the web-app further for continuous voice input feature, as it'll be available on _mobile app_ version.
